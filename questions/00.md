# Multiple Dropdowns Question

The [a1] operator allows us to assign values to variables and the [a2] operator
allows us to compare two numerical values for equality.

## Correct

- `=`
- a1

> Correct! The `=` is the assignment operator.

## Incorrect

- `==`
- a1

> Not quite. The `==` is the equal operator.

## Incorrect

- `=`
- a2

> Not quite. The `=` is the assignment operator in Java. It is important to note
> that the `=` operator **does not** mean "equals" like it does in mathematics.
> If we want to compare two numerical values, we need to use the `==` operator,
> which is the relational operator for equals.
